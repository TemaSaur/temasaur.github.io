					As you already know my name is Artemy and I'm a developer.
				</p>
				<p>
					It's been about two years since I started programming. My favourite languages to code are Python and Java, but I also know C++, C#, HTML, CSS (+Sass), JavaScript (+jQuery, NodeJS), PHP.
				</p>
				<p>
					I love solving challenging problems so I've spend a lot of time designing algorithms and competing in Competitive Programming contests.
				</p>
				<p>
					Right now my goals are to enter University and to get a job as a software engineer.
